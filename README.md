# Inventation

to do:
 - explain purpose of site
 - explain what the site is

The purpose of this web app is to be used for the creation
of website that contain event/invatation information. Like similar
web apps, this site will not only serve as a place of information for
attendees for the site's respective event, but also as an alternate method
for rsvp'ing to said event incase of standard mailing issues.  Each site
is created by the user via the used of simple button presses.  Each button press
will allow for the inclusion of different features (i.e. event info box, countdown timer, ...).
The initial idea is for each site to be a single page site.  However, the inclusion of
multiple pages may be a potential.

## Getting Started

to do:
  - explain how to get to the site
  - explain the basic features of the site

The user begins with a completely blank page and a sidebar with
a list of option that the user can choose from.  Clicking an option
will append it onto the page. (will need to figure out how ordering will work)
The user can append as many or as few feature as needed for their site.
There will also be buttons that will allow for the addition of images.
One button will be used to add an image to the background of the page, while
the other will be used to add images to the foreground.

### Userflow
to do:
  - describe how the creating user will interact with the site
  - describe how the invited user will interact with the site

The creating user will enter Inventations homepage where they will
be presented with a form (username, password, first name, last name
to fill out.  After filling out the form they will then click on the 
"Create" button to finalize their user profile. **They will be redirected to a website creation page
that will appear blank, or, they will need to click on a "Go to Page" button to
get to their site.**(create a test for this)  The creation sidebar will appear automatically.  The user
will then begin choosing the features for their site.  They will be able to experiment
with the order of features to fit their look. When the website is finished, the user
will be able to see a preview version of the site before publishing it (via herokuapp).  When publishing
the site, the user will be prompted to create a master username and password in order
to access the page.  There will be a note shown that tells the user that these two inputs
will be required for their guest to also access the site, and should be conveyed to them
via the invitations that are sent out (as well as the site url).

The invited users will visit the url found in their invitations and use the username and password
to gain access to the site.  They will find browse the page and select their decision into the RSVP
section.  

If the user has the desire to remove themselves from Inventation, they have the ability to do so via
the "Delete Profile" button on the homepage.  **This in turn will also delete their site.**(create test for this)
